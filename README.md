My first attempt at creating and publishing a brutal but simple website

I want to make it functional and I'm not so keen to race ahead but just making it functional rather than pretty is my main aim.

Recipes included:

    Simple Low-Tyramine Recipes 

    - Yoghurt smoothie 
    
    - Chicken Korma Curry 

    - Broccolini with lemon

I created 4 seperate pages; 1 for the index page and 3 for the recipes. 
Just using HTML I created lists and headings and added a pictures for all the recipes.
I'm unsatisfied with how the pages look but hope to learn more and come back to it armed with knowledge of CSS.
