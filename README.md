My first attempt at creating and publishing a brutal but simple website

I want to make it functional and I'm not so keen to race ahead but just making it functional rather than pretty is my main aim.

Recipes included:

    Simple Low-Tyramine Recipes 

    - Yoghurt smoothie 
    
    - Chicken Korma Curry 

    - Broccolini with lemon
